# About me

## Description

Hi, I'm Marcin. I do stuff in Rust :crab:.
My personal interests lie in CLI utilities and the software development cycle in general.

:wrench: I'm familiar with Python and C++,
but these mostly come up as work necessities or one-off thingies.

:alembic: I enjoy learning functional languages and the functional paradigm in general.
My personal favorites are Haskell and F#.

:package: I maintain a [handful](https://repology.org/maintainer/tranzystorek.io%40protonmail.com) of packages over on [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/).

:sauropod: I have also found [Deno](https://deno.land/) interesting, check it out!
