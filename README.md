# About me

## Description

Hi, I'm Marcin. I do stuff in Rust :crab:.
My personal interests lie in CLI utilities and the software development cycle in general.

:alembic: You'll occasionally find me tinkering with things like functional languages, **broadly** defined web dev, et cetera.

:package: I maintain a [handful](https://repology.org/maintainer/tranzystorek.io%40protonmail.com) of packages over on [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/).

Note: apart from contributing to existing projects, I'm not very active on Github.
Check out my [Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/tranzystorek-io) if you want to see new projects and the like.
